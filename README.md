- **Smart AI DJ Transitions**: Auto-calculates BPMs and trims `start`/`finish` offsets for continuous, seamless crossfading.
- **Hybrid Lyrics & Universal Links**: Instant lyrics via LRCLIB + universal `song.link` generator for sharing songs across Spotify/YouTube/Tidal.
- **Playlist Management & Export**: Nested folders, deduplication, auto-sorting, and export to JSON, CSV, or Markdown.
